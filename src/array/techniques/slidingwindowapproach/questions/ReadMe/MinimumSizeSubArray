#Detail explanation of minimum size
To solve this problem, we can use the Sliding Window technique with two pointers. Here's the algorithm:

1.Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the first element of the array.
2.Initialize a variable minLength to the length of the array plus 1.
3.Initialize a variable sum to 0.
4.While the right pointer is less than the length of the array:
A. Add the value at the right pointer to sum.
B. While sum is greater than or equal to target:
i. Update minLength to the minimum of its current value and the difference between the right and left pointers plus 1.
ii. Subtract the value at the left pointer from sum.
iii. Increment the left pointer.
c. Increment the right pointer.
5.If minLength is still equal to the length of the array plus 1, return 0, since there is no subarray with a sum greater than or equal to target.
6.Otherwise, return minLength.


In this code, we initialize the left and right pointers to the first element of the array.
We also initialize minLength to the length of the array plus 1, since that is the largest possible value for the length of a subarray.
We then iterate through the array using the right pointer. We add the value at the right pointer to sum,
and then we use a while loop to move the left pointer as far to the right as possible while keeping the sum greater than or equal to target.
If the current minLength is still equal to the length of the array plus 1,
we return 0 since there is no subarray with a sum greater than or equal to target. Otherwise, we return minLength.

The expression right - left + 1 gives us the length of the current subarray between the left and right pointers.
We add 1 because we want to include both the left and right endpoints in the subarray.
We use this expression to update the minLength variable. If the current subarray has a length less than or equal to minLength
and a sum greater than or equal to target, we update minLength to the length of the current subarray.
By updating minLength in this way, we keep track of the length of the shortest subarray
with a sum greater than or equal to target that we have found so far.

We initialize the variable minLength to nums.length + 1 because we want to use it to keep track of the shortest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target.
If we initialize minLength to nums.length, then we will not be able to determine if we have found any subarray with a sum greater than or
equal to the target if the sum of all elements in the array is less than the target. In this case, the length of any subarray will be greater
than the length of the original array nums.
By initializing minLength to nums.length + 1, we ensure that if we do not find any subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target,
then minLength will remain unchanged, and we can use the condition minLength == nums.length + 1 to check if we found any subarray with a sum greater
than or equal to the target. If we did not find any such subarray, we return 0 as specified in the problem statement.
