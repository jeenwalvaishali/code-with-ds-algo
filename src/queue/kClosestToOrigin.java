Problem Description
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance, which is calculated as: (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2). You may return the answer in any order.
The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance of [1,3] from the origin is (sqrt{10}).
The distance of [-2,2] from the origin is (sqrt{8}).
Since (sqrt{8} < sqrt{10}), [-2,2] is the closest point.

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation:
The distance of [3,3] from the origin is (sqrt{18}).
The distance of [5,-1] from the origin is (sqrt{26}).
The distance of [-2,4] from the origin is (sqrt{20}).
The two closest points are [3,3] and [-2,4].
