[**What is the road map for learning data structure and algorithms in Java?**](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-road-map-for-learning-data-structure-and-algorithms-in-Java)

1.  Basic Syntax

2.  Array

3.  String

4.  Collection Framework ( No need to learn all OR skip now & learn later)

5.  Recursion

6.  Searching algorithms ( Linear & Binary)

7.  Sorting algorithms ( Learn Recursion at this time it's very helpful in some sorting algorithms)

    1.  Bubble Sort

    2.  Selection sort

    3.  Insertion sort

    4.  Radix sort

    5.  Quick sort ( IMP)

    6.  Merge sort ( IMP)

    7.  Heap sort ( It's your choice )

8.  Oops Concept ( Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism)

9.  Stack

10.  Queue & it's types ( + Priority Queue)

11.  Linked list & it's types ( Basic Implementation & implement Using Collection Framework as well)

12.  HashTable , hashcode functions, hashmap

13.  Tree ( InOrder, PostOrder, PreOrder traversal) All types of trees. Binary tree, BST, Level order, AVL tree & more. Their operations.( Algorithms like minimum spanning tree)

14.  Graph ( BFS, DFS, Algorithms like shortest path etc .)


For Competitive :-

1.  Backtracking

2.  Dynamic programming

3.  Etcâ€¦( left to explore)
